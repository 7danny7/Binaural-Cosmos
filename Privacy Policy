# PRIVACY POLICY

Effective date: **20 September 2025**

## 1  WHO WE ARE

App name: **Binaural Cosmos**
Developer: **CatManSoftwareStudios**
Email: **[catmansoftwarestudio@gmail.com]**
Country: **South Africa**

## 2  SUMMARY OF DATA PRACTICES

We **do not collect, store, or transmit personal data to our servers**. The App works **offline** and does not request the Android INTERNET permission.

Trial enforcement and purchase validation happen **on-device**. The App queries **Google Play Billing** locally to determine whether your one-time unlock is active; we receive only entitlement status and product details needed to show purchase options. We do not receive your payment card details.


## 3  WHAT THE APP STORES ON YOUR DEVICE

The App stores user preferences **locally** using Android’s SharedPreferences and/or Jetpack DataStore:

* **Theme and background selection** (including a local image URI if you choose one),
* **Tone choices and preset selections**,
* **Simple UI state** (e.g., last screen, toggles),
* **Trial status: a local timestamp when your free trial starts and a “last-seen” timestamp to prevent simple clock changes (TRIAL_START_UTC, TRIAL_LAST_SEEN_UTC).
* **Purchase state:** whether lifetime unlock is active (derived from Google Play purchase checks).
* **EULA acceptance details** including:
    * **Acceptance timestamp** (local device time when you accepted),
    * **EULA fingerprint** (partial SHA-256 hash of the accepted EULA text),
    * **EULA effective date** (parsed directly from the local EULA document).

All of the above information remains on your device and is **never transmitted** to us.

We use Android **SharedPreferences** and/or **Jetpack DataStore**, which store small key-value settings **inside the app sandbox** (internal storage). These mechanisms do **not** require external storage permissions.

These values are used solely on your device to enforce the trial, remember preferences, and reflect your purchase status; they are not uploaded.



## 4  PERMISSIONS WE REQUEST

| Permission                                | Why we need it                                    | Notes                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **FOREGROUND\_SERVICE + MEDIA\_PLAYBACK** | Keep audio running while the screen is off.       | Required for stable playback.                  |
| **POST\_NOTIFICATIONS** (Android 13+)     | Show playback controls in the notification shade. | Optional; you can deny it.                     |
| **VIBRATE**                               | Optional haptic feedback on button taps.          | Optional; you can disable haptics in settings. |

No camera, microphone, location, contacts, or storage-write permissions are requested.

When you pick a custom background image, the App uses the Android **Storage Access Framework**. You grant a **read-only, persistable URI** to that single image so it can be displayed later. The App does **not** request write access and does **not** upload the image anywhere.

## 5  THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The App uses core Android / Google Play libraries, including **Play Billing** to process the one-time unlock and to restore purchases. Google may process limited technical and account data under its own privacy policy when you interact with Play Billing. We do not use Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, ad SDKs, or other trackers.


## 6  PURCHASES, BILLING & REFUNDS

Payments are handled by **Google Play** under Google’s terms. For refunds, please refer to Google Play’s refund policy. The App queries Google Play Billing **on-device** to verify entitlement and to restore your one-time unlock on the same Google account. We may cache a local “entitled/unlocked” flag so the App can reflect your status offline. We do not receive your payment card information.

## 7  WHEN YOU CONTACT US

If you email us (e.g., support requests), we will process the content of your message, your email address, and any information you choose to provide **solely** to respond and maintain records of our communications.
**Retention:** We generally retain support emails for up to **24 months** unless a longer period is required by law or to resolve an issue, after which we delete them.
**Legal bases (GDPR/UK GDPR, where applicable):** performance of a contract (support), legitimate interests (responding to inquiries), or legal obligation.

## 8  CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Binaural Cosmos is **not directed at children under 13** and intentionally collects no data from anyone. If you believe a child has provided us personal information via email, please contact us so we can delete it.

## 9  YOUR RIGHTS

Because the App itself does not collect personal data, there is typically nothing for us to access, rectify, or erase. If you contact us and provide personal data (e.g., by email), you may have rights under **POPIA**, **GDPR/UK GDPR**, or **CCPA/CPRA**, including the right to access or delete that information. To exercise these rights, email **[catmansoftwarestudio@gmail.com](mailto:catmansoftwarestudio@gmail.com)**.
**Do Not Sell or Share (CCPA/CPRA):** We **do not sell** or **share** personal information as defined by California law, nor do we use cross-context behavioral advertising.

## 10  SECURITY

There is no server-side storage. On-device preferences remain within your device’s app sandbox. We rely on standard Android security protections and your device’s safeguards. If you email us, we use reasonable administrative measures to protect that correspondence.

## 11  INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

We do not transfer App data off your device. If you email us, your message may be processed by email service providers that route data internationally. Where relevant, we rely on appropriate safeguards provided by those providers.

## 12  DATA RETENTION & DELETION

* **On-device settings:** You control them. Uninstalling the App or using Android’s **"Clear Data"** permanently deletes them.
* **Support emails:** Retained up to **24 months** (see Section 7) and then deleted, unless we must keep them longer for legal reasons.
* **Purchase status:** If you clear data or reinstall, you may need to use “Restore Purchase” so Google Play can re-confirm your one-time unlock on that account.

## 13  CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

If we add cloud features, analytics, or otherwise change our practices, we will update this policy and notify users in-app or via the store listing. The “Effective date” above will be updated, and continued use after changes take effect means you accept the updated policy.
