PRIVACY POLICY
==============

1  WHO WE ARE
-------------
App name: **Binaural Cosmos**  
Developer: **CatManSoftwareStudios**  
Email: catmansoftwarestudio@gmail.com  
Country: South Africa 

2  WHAT DATA WE COLLECT
----------------------
We **do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data**.  
The app runs entirely on the user’s device and:

* plays mathematically generated audio,
* stores user preferences (theme, background image URI, tone choices) **locally** in Android’s Shared Preferences,
* never uploads files, images, or analytics events to any server.

3  PERMISSIONS WE REQUEST
-------------------------
| Permission                     | Why we need it                          |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **FOREGROUND_SERVICE + MEDIA_PLAYBACK** | To keep audio running while the screen is off. |
| **POST_NOTIFICATIONS** (Android 13+)   | To show playback controls in the notification shade. |
| **VIBRATE**                              | To provide optional haptic feedback on button taps. |

No camera, microphone, location, or storage-write permissions are requested.

4  THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
-----------------------
The app uses only core Android / Google Play libraries (Play-Billing).  
Google processes your one-time purchase; we never see your payment details.  
No Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, Ads, or other SDKs are integrated.

5  DATA RETENTION & DELETION
----------------------------
All settings are stored on-device.  
Uninstalling the app or using Android’s “Clear Data” function permanently deletes them.

6  CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
---------------------
Binaural Cosmos is **not directed at children under 13** and intentionally collects no data from anyone.

7  YOUR RIGHTS
--------------
Because we store no personal data, there is nothing to access, rectify, or erase.  
If you have questions, email us at **catmansoftwarestudio@gmail.com**.

8  CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
-------------------------
If we add cloud features or analytics in the future, we will update this policy and notify users in-app.
